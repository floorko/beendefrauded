    <h1>Attention Military Members and Veterans</h1>
    <h2>Former Clients of Floor Ko LLC – El Paso, Texas</h2>

    <div class="date">February 27, 2026</div>

    <p class="highlight">YOU HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED</p>

    <p>
      My name is Samuel Martínez Roque. I was employed by Ramon Ontiveros at Floor Ko, LLC from
      2021–2024. During my employment, I documented repeated and deliberate overcharging of clients,
      including active-duty service members and veterans, based on assumptions about military pay,
      benefits, or perceived financial stability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clients were routinely charged inflated prices, billed for services advertised as free, or
      offered improper “tax exemptions” in exchange for cash payments. These practices were systematic
      and documented in a backup file I personally generated after I realized attempts were being made
      to alter or erase records.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I refused to participate further, I was subjected to retaliation, wage withholding,
      threats of deportation, civil litigation threats, and explicit death threats. These threats
      escalated after I refused to surrender evidentiary records, despite Mr. Ontiveros already
      possessing copies.
    </p>

    <p>
      A formal report has been submitted to the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) due to
      the involvement of military-affiliated victims and the nature of the fraud and intimidation
      involved. Reports have also been made to other state and federal authorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am contacting you because records indicate that military families and veterans were
      specifically targeted for financial exploitation. I am prepared to provide documentation,
      timestamps, and sworn testimony to affected clients, subject to identity verification.
    </p>

    <p>
      This disclosure is made in good faith, for transparency, and to preserve evidence. I gain
      nothing by silence. Continued intimidation only reinforces the necessity of making this
      information public.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a service member or veteran and believe you may have been overcharged or misled,
      you have the right to know.
    </p>

    "reviewBody": "I had a very disappointing experience with this flooring installation company. The customer service was poor from the start, and the team arrived late on installation day without any prior notice. They seemed unorganized and unprofessional, taking longer than expected to complete the job. The quality of the flooring was not what I was promised, with several visible defects. I reached out for assistance, but they were unresponsive and didn’t address my concerns properly. I DO NOT recommend this company to anyone looking for reliable and quality service."

    "reviewBody": "TERRIBLE AND IRRESPONSIBLE!! I hired Ramon Ontiveros over a year ago to remodel my hardwood floor and bathroom shower, but they did a terrible job. They installed a plastic floor that keeps peeling off, and I've had multiple leaks in the bathroom they remodeled. For over two years, he hasn't bothered to answer my calls. Now the water leak has spread to my kitchen downstairs. Crappy work, and Ramon is irresponsible. I will never hire them again. I don't recommend them. This Ramon Ontiveros isn't a good person. He lives at 441 Huerta St in El Paso, Texas."
